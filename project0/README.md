## PROJECT 0 - HARVARD CS50W
This project is part of Harvard`s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript Course.

    * It has a navigation menu from within it is possible to navigate to the others pages, directly or indirectly.
* Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
    * List has been implemented in full-stack-learning.html
    * Table has been implemented in full-stack-learning.html

    * The web has a css folder with two stylesheets.
* Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
    * All of these requirements are easily found in the stylesheets.
